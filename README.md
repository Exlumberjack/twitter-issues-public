## To-do

- [ ] can we have a graphic of, say, state of Wisconsin with zip codes delineated and, when hovering over a given zip code, tweets from that zip code appear? Can htmlwidgets R package do this?

- [ ] make a Makefile to automate analysis.
- [ ] elaborate examples to make a full vignette
- [ ] put Robert's functions (and a small data set) into a R package.
